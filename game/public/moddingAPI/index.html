        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In order to start modding you need to be able to access the developer console.
            If you don't know how to do this, google search "How do I open the developer tools on my browser?",
            replacing
            "my browser" with your browser.
            Once you have the developer console open, you can start running the code below.
        </p>


        <h3 id="structure">Basic Game Structure</h3>
        <p>
            The game is made using JavaScript, and you will be interacting with the game's JavaScript in order to mod
            it.
            This guide expects you to have a basic overview of JavaScript, and if you don't, you can check out the <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide">MDN Web Docs</a> for more in-depth
            information. The lobby runs in a <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web
                Worker</a>, which is a separate thread from the main thread. This means that you can't directly access
            the
            game's JavaScript from the console. Instead, you will be using a custom made socket API which sends commands
            to
            and from the main thread, which runs the client. This API is what you will be using to mod the game.
        </p>

        <h3 id="concepts">Important JavaScript Concepts</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="mini-heading" id="concept-promise">Promises</span> are a way to handle asynchronous code in
            JavaScript. They are
            objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting
            value.
            You can read more about them <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">here</a>.<br /><br />

            <span class="mini-heading" id="concept-async-await">Async/Await</span> is a way to write asynchronous code
            that looks synchronous.
            It's a way to write promises in a more readable way. You can read more about them <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">here</a>.<br /><br />

            <span class="mini-heading" id="concept-web-worker">Web Workers</span> are a way to run JavaScript code in a
            separate thread from the
            main thread. This is useful for running code that may take a long time to run, as it won't block the main
            thread.
            You can read more about them <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">here</a>.<br /><br />

            <span class="mini-heading" id="concept-broadcast-channel">Broadcast Channel</span> is a way to communicate
            between different windows
            or tabs, or in our case, the lobby Web Worker. You can read more about them <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel">here</a>.<br /><br />

            <span class="mini-heading" id="concept-websocket">Websocket</span> is a way to communicate between the
            client and the server. In our case,
            you will establish connection between a lobby server which routes packets between clients and lobbies. You
            can read
            more about them <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">here</a>.
        </p>

        <div class="warning">
            <h2>Warning:</h2>
            <p>
                The rest of this guide will assume you have a basic understanding of JavaScript syntax, and the concepts above.
                If you don't, you may have a hard time understanding what the code and responses below do or mean. It is up to
                you to learn these concepts before continuing. <b>We are not responsible for teaching basic JavaScript.</b>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="syncInfo">Synchronous Information</h2>
        <p>
            The synchronous information is the information that will be returned instantly. This information is stored
            in
            the client, and therefore has no need to return an asynchronous response.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting a Petal's Index</h3>
        <p>
            This function will return the index of the petal whose name you've provided. If the petal doesn't exist,
            it will return -1.
            You should use this index to pass to other functions that require a petal index, however recent support
            has been added that lets you directly pass the petal's name into it.
        </p>
        <pre id="syncPetalIndex"></pre>

        <h3>Getting a Mob's Index</h3>
        <p>
            This function will return the index of the mob whose name you've provided. If the mob doesn't exist,
            it will return -1.
            You should use this index to pass to other functions that require a mob index, however recent support
            has been added that lets you directly pass the mob's name into it.
        </p>
        <pre id="syncMobIndex"></pre>

        <h3>Getting a Tier's Index</h3>
        <p>
            This function will return the index of the tier whose name you've provided. If the tier doesn't exist,
            it will return -1.
            You should use this index to pass to other functions that require a tier index, however recent support
            has been added that lets you directly pass the tier's name into it.
        </p>
        <pre id="syncRarityIndex"></pre>

        <h3>Next Available Indices</h3>
        <p>
            These two functions will return the next available petal and mob indices. This is useful for adding custom
            petals and mobs, as you can use these indices to prevent collisions between your custom petals and mobs and
            the preexisting ones. These numbers will always be different as new petals and mobs are added to the game.
        </p>
        <pre id="nextAvailableIndices"></pre>

        <h3>Help</h3>
        <p>
            While this function doesn't do anything or have any arguments, it will open a new tab in your browser to
            this
            page.
        </p>
        <pre id="help"></pre>

        <div class="warning">
            <h2>Warning:</h2>
            <p>
                The rest of the functions are not synchronous and will return a promise. This means that you will need
                to
                use the .then() function to access the data.
                You can also use the async/await syntax to make the code look cleaner in a top-level async function.
                If you need more information on promises, you can check out the <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">MDN
                    Web
                    Docs</a>.
                More information on async/await can be found <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The response will contain an "ok" field that will be true if the request was successful and false if it
                was
                rejected.
                The "message" field will contain a message that will help you understand why the request was rejected,
                or if
                it was successful.
                The "data" field will contain the data you requested if the request was successful. It may be in many
                different forms.
                Your responses wil allmost always look something like this:
            </p>
            <pre id="asyncResponseTemplate"></pre>
        </div>

        <h2 id="getPlayers">Get Players</h2>
        <p>
            This function's response's data section will contain an array of all the players in the room.
        </p>
        <pre id="getPlayersRequest"></pre>
        <p>
            The response will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre id="getPlayersResponse"></pre>

        <h2 id="getMobs">Get Mobs</h2>
        <p>
            This function's response's data section will contain an array of all the mobs in the room.
        </p>
        <pre id="getMobsRequest"></pre>
        <p>
            The response will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre id="getMobsResponse"></pre>

        <h2 id="spawnMob">Spawn Mob</h2>
        <p>
            This function will spawn a mob in the room. The response will contain the mob that was spawned.
            You must provide two arguments, the index and the rarity ID. They must both be valid numbers in the index
            and
            rarity ranges respectively. If you don't want to remember the index and rarity ID, you can use the
            <a href="#syncInfo">Synchronous Functions</a> to get them, or, with recent support, simply provide the mob's
            name and rarity name.
        </p>
        <pre id="spawnMobRequest"></pre>
        <p>
            The response will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre id="spawnMobResponse"></pre>

        <h2 id="spawnAIFlower">Spawn AI Flower</h2>
        <p>
            This function, much like the spawnMob function, spawns an AI Flower in the room. The response will contain the AI Flower that was spawned. 
            There are two arguments that are required: the rarity of the AI Flower's petals, and the AI Flower's level.
        </p>
        <pre id="spawnAIFlowerRequest"></pre>
        <p>
            The response will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre id="spawnAIFlowerResponse"></pre>

        <h2 id="getRoomInfo">Get Room Info</h2>
        <p>
            This function will return the room info. The response will contain the room info.
        </p>
        <pre id="getRoomInfoRequest"></pre>
        <p>
            The response will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre id="getRoomInfoResponse"></pre>

        <h2 id="setRoomInfo">Set Room Info</h2>
        <p>
            This function will set the room info. The response will contain the room info.
            You must weather the room's sizing is dynamic or static. If the room is dynamic, the room will resize to fit
            the
            number of players, and the mob cap will be automatically adjusted as well. If the room is static, the room
            will
            not resize, and the mob cap will not be adjusted.<br /><br />
            If the supplied first argument is "false" (static), then the second and third arguments are the room width
            and
            height respectively. The fourth argument is the mob cap, and the fifth argument is the wave to set (required, but doesn't work in gamemodes other than waves).
        </p>
        <pre id="setRoomInfoRequest"></pre>
        <p>
            The response will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre id="setRoomInfoResponse"></pre>

        <h2 id="getPetalInfo">Get Petal Info</h2>
        <p>
            This function will return the petal info. The response will contain the petal info.
            Provide the petal's index or direct name to get the petal's info. The response will
            contain the PetalConfig object of the petal you requested if successful.
        </p>
        <pre id="getPetalInfoRequest"></pre>

        <p>
            The response will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre id="getPetalInfoResponse"></pre>

        <h2 id="addCustomPetal">Add Custom Petal</h2>
        <p>
            This function will add a custom petal to the room. The response will contain the PetalConfig object of
            the petal you just created if successful. All arguments in the constructor are required. Because it's a
            new petal, you must provide a drawing object as described below. Additional information is provided as of
            use cases. In order to give good drawings, please read up on the HTML
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">Canvas API</a>
        </p>
        Here are the default parameters for the petal options:
        <pre id="addCustomPetalStructure"></pre>
        </p>
        <pre id="addCustomPetalRequest"></pre>
        <p>
            The response will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre id="addCustomPetalResponse"></pre>

        <h2 id="editCustomPetal">Edit Petal</h2>
        <p>
            This function will edit a custom petal in the room. The response will contain the PetalConfig object of
            the petal you just edited if successful. You should use an existing petal config retrieved by either the
            creation of a custom petal, or the fetching of another existing petal. Only what you change will be applied.
        </p>
        <pre id="editCustomPetalRequest"></pre>

        <p>
            The response will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre id="editCustomPetalResponse"></pre>

        <h2 id="deletePetal">Delete Petal</h2>
        <p>
            This function will delete a custom petal in the room. The response will tell you if you were successful or
            not.
        </p>
        <pre id="deletePetalRequest"></pre>

        <h2 id="setSlot">Set Slot</h2>
        <p>
            This function will set the slot of a player. The response will contain the player that was modified.
            You must provide four arguments: clientID, slotID, index, rarity. The clientID is the ID of the player you
            want
            to modify. The slotID is the slot you want to modify. The index is the index of the petal you want to set.
            The
            rarity is the rarity of the petal you want to set.

            If you don't want to remember the index and rarity ID, you can use the <a href="#syncInfo">Synchronous
                Functions</a> to get them.
        </p>
        <pre id="setSlotRequest"></pre>
        <p>
            The response will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre id="setSlotResponse"></pre>

        <h2 id="setSlotAmount">Set Slot Amount</h2>
        <p>
            This function will set the amount of slots a player has. The response will contain the player that was
            modified.
            You must provide two arguments: clientID, amount. The clientID is the ID of the player you want to modify.
            The
            amount is the amount of slots you want to set.
        </p>
        <pre id="setSlotAmountRequest"></pre>
        <p>
            The response will look like this:
        </p>
        <pre id="setSlotAmountResponse"></pre>

        <h2 id="quickSlots">Quickly Setting Slots</h2>
        <div class="warning">
            <h2>Warning:</h2>
            <p>
                Because this is asynchronouse, we must first set the amount of slots, then set the slots. This is
                because if
                we don't wait
                for the first request to finish, the second requests may not be supported in their index bounds.
